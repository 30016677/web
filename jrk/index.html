    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jess. I'm currently studying in my second year of a Creative Industries degree majoring in Graphic Design. I have a genuine passion for helping brands create a memorable identity whether that be through logos, product design or editing film with motion graphics. Every project deserves attention to detail and the highest level of quality.</p>
    <p>I'm open to any project, nothing is too small or big. Send me an email and we can discuss the future your brand could have!</p>
